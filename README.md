Sierra Wireless Innovation Summit 2016 mangOH Demos
===================================================

This repository contains source code for the two mangOH demos shown at the
Sierra Wireless Innovation Sumit 2016.


Container Tracking
------------------
Simulates tracking of a shipping container using a mangOH Green.  The
demonstration makes use of a SensorTag bluetooth device which integrates a
number of sensors.  The demo supports alarm generation and pushing logged data
to AirVantage web services.


Industrial Automation
---------------------
This demo shows the mangOH using a CAN IoT card to control a CAN device with
inputs and outputs.  The device under control provides a "kill switch" which
allows for the machine to be turned off and back on again.  This demo also
provides a remote kill switch through AirVantage web services.
